          <h2>Hello! This page was created to help anyone who might be looking for information on what my mission is looking to be. This site was created so that I could have a better understanding of basic and advanced HTML elements. I am currently attending Correlation One Software Development Bootcamp. This page will demonstrate everything I have learned up until this point.</h2>

        <h4>My name is Richard Goebel. I am currently employed at Amazon. My facility is the first Amazon Air facility in the United States. I've been with the company for 3 and a half years. My current role is Learning Ambassador. I live in Jamestown, Ohio, which is about 30 minutes from the facility I work at. I have a lovely wife named Autumn, and two wonderful boys named Owen and Connor. These kids do not live at home, so now we have four spoiled cats that take up a lot of our time. If I'm not at home or at work, you can usually find me out in nature playing disc golf. It has become less of a hobby and now more of an obsession. When the weather is nice, my wife and I enjoy going to festivals. I'm creating this webpage as a landing for anyone who may be interested in getting to know more about me or what it is that I do. Please refer to the links below and don't forget to subscribe to my blog!</h4>

<i>"When I first started my journey as a web developer, I was worried that I might be too old to learn new skills in a foreign industry. Here I find myself a month later and learning at a pace that I thought I was incapable of doing. I've learned the basics of HTML, as well as some intermediate to advanced HTML. Most recently, we've been introduced to CSS. I have a yearning to learn more about both languages. A month in and I'm going strong. Learning to build tables was my favorite thing so far. I used them to build most of this page. I can't wait for what the future holds."</i>
